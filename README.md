Help us track inspirational quotes!

This is a very simple implementation of an api to manage quotes, it doesn't have unit testing, integration testing, transaction management, 
swagger support, metrics, actuator, proper logging, etc. because i feel like this is just an exercise.

The application is written in Java + Spring boot and the information is stored in an in memory database to allow you 
to execute it without any dependency.

To execute the app you need to execute the following commands:

`mvn clean install`

`mvn spring-boot:run`

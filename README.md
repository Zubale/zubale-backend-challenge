# Zubale Backend Challenge 

At Zubale we are all about raising people up and inspiring people. To do that, we need a great way to track inspirational quotes. So, we need you to write a service that will let people suggest quotes and vote on the ones they like the best.

We hope doing this is fun, but we are also are always looking for the best people to join our team. We will be happy to review your submission and consider you for a possition at Zubale. 

The requirements are:
1. Fork this repo and clone it to start working
2. Build out a service
3. Provide an endpoint to allow quotes to be submitted 
4. Provide an endpoint to allow votes on quotes to be submitted 
5. Provide an endpoint that returns the list of quotes in the order with the most votes
6. Push your code early and often 
7. Provide a readme explaining your work and how to run it
8. Include how to contact you in the readme (WhatsApp & Enail)
9. When you are done, open a PR from your fork to this repo

Your solution does not need a front end, it can be just APIs. You are also free to use any technology or libraries you like, but extra points will be given for Kotlin and Spring.
